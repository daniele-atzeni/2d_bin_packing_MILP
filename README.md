# 2d Bin Packing Mixed Integer Linear Programming with PuLP

In order to run the scripts, you have to add cbc.exe and/or cplex.exe in your repository.
You can also modify the path variable in selve_cbc and solve_cplex methods in problem.py, 
setting it to the path where solvers are saved.

PuLP LPProblem class does not support the creation of a model from file. For this reason
in order to reproduce your experiment you can use the seed parameter when you call
the create_data method.

- main.py:
  it creates an instance of the problem and solves it with cbc and cplex, with default
  parameters. It also creates problem.lp, with the problem instance, problem_init.png,
  that shows the polygons of the instance, and problem_sol_cbc.png and problem_sol_cplex.png,
  that show the solution of the problem.
 
 - cbc_vs_cplex.py:
  it creates instances of the problem with different values of the number of polygons,
  solves them with cbc and cplex, computes the time needed and saves everything in 
  cbc_vs_cplex.txt.
 
 - cbc_grid_search.py:
  It creates an instance of the problem and solves it with different combination of 
  cbc parameters, computes the time needed for each combination and saves everything
  in cbc_grid_search.txt.
  
  - old_M_vs_new_M.py:
   It creates 5 instances of the problem and solves them using default cplex and a different
   model which use a different value of M, computes the time needed for each instance 
   and saves everything in old_M_vs_new_M.txt.
